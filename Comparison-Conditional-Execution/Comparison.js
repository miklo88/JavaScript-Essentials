// "==" compares to what is to the left of it and to what is to the right of it
// comparison operators always return a boolean value.
// you can compare, booleans, strings etc
// in comparing strings it is case sensitive as well.
console.log(10 == 10); //true
console.log("hello" == "Hello"); //false, case sensitive
// "!=" - is not not equal to
console.log(10 != 100); //true, 10 is NOT equal to 100
// "===" - checks the values and datatypes are the same
console.log("string" === "string"); //true, the string is the string
console.log("string10" === "string2"); //false
// > < <= >= - greater, less than equal to
console.log(10 <= 100); // true, 10 is less than 100
